# Node.js Random Delay Server

This Node.js server simulates a random delay in response to GET requests. 

**Features:**

- Generates a random delay between 500ms and 1500ms upon receiving a GET request.
- Responds with a message confirming the request was processed and includes CPU and OS information (optional).
- Provides a basic framework for creating a server with a simulated delay in Node.js.

**Running the Server:**

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory and run `npm install` (if there's a `package.json` file with dependencies).
4. Run the server using `node server.js`.

**Access:**

Once the server starts, you can access it through a web browser at `http://localhost:3000/` (or the specified port in your`server.js`). Send a GET request (e.g., by refreshing the page) to experience the random delay.

**Note:**

This is a basic example and currently only includes the essential `server.js` file. Additional files and functionalities may be added in the future.
